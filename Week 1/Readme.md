# Week 1 Progress

During the first week, I worked on several mini projects that covered various programming concepts, including:

## 🖥️ Programming Concepts Explored
- **Functions & Conditionals**: Implemented basic functions and conditional statements.
- **Data Structures**: Worked with lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Implemented basic arithmetic, temperature conversion, and min/max calculations.

## 📌 Mini Projects Completed
- **User Data Collection**: Gathered and processed user input.
- **Even or Odd Number Checker**: Determined if a given number is even or odd.
- **Temperature Converter**: Converted temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Inventory Management System**: Built a simple inventory system using dictionaries.
- **Statistical Computations**: Calculated mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and Euclidean distance.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Concepts Explored
- **Sigmoid Function**: Implemented the sigmoid activation function.
- **Root Square Error (RSE)**: Computed RSE for error measurement.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculated similarity between two vectors.
- **Basic Linear Regression**: Implemented a simple linear regression model.

🚀 Looking forward to learning more in the upcoming weeks!
